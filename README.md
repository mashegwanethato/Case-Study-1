The purpose of this project was to to do analysis for the in coming CEO for Bright Coffee Shop. 
The CEO is new and has to be given a sense of understanding how the business functioned, so he can grow it from that point 

I made use of the provided dataset, which was the Bright Coffee Sales dataset. 

I made use of 4 tools in the analysis process namely:
Miro - I used Miro to plan out my analysis process, outlining what I plan on doing and some of the queries I plan on including in my analysis.
SnowFlake - I made use of snowflake to analyze my data and code the queries I planned on coding. In in process, I also did some exploratory data analysis to understand my data better before forming the finaL code. 
Excel - Excel is very essential because it allows one to then visualize the finding they have and that is why I then mad use of Excel, so I could visualize the data. Through Excel I generated pivot tables from my findings and then created graphs to visualize the data findings.
Canva - I finally made use of Canva to create a presentation to make my visualization apealing to the eye for the CEO. This presentation full outlines the data findings from the analysis done in SnowFlake

My final finds suggested that:
- Bright Coffee Shop has a lot of potential to grow
- The morning is where a lot of sales are made
- Mondays and Fridays are where most sales are made
- June is the month where most sales where made which suggests that most sales are made in winter
- The peaks hour of day for sales is 10:00 which is in the morning.

The main objective of the anaylsis was to give the new CEO a look at the sales of the business and we did that.
